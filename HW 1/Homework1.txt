Submission Instructions: 
Submit your answers using the hw1.py skeleton file included with this assignment (look at the homework tab in Brightspace/content). The python file is read by the autograder. It is important to have a syntax-error free file. The first and most important step is to write your Purdue username in the username function. Then, write your queries in the query1 to query15 functions. Your query answer should have the same attributes(columns) exactly in the same order as the expected result shown in each question. However, the rows can be in any order (i.e., you do not need to sort your rows). Column headers can be different. Before submitting your Python file execute the file using the command: Python3 hw1.py The output should contain all of your queries. Getting the correct output ensures that the autograder will be able to read your queries.

Submit your hw1.py in Brightspace/Assignments/Assignment 1
Make sure you submit the right file. 

Database import instructions:
For this assignment, use vieo_games.db SQLite database included with this assignment. You can open the database by simply typing .open video_games.db in the SQLite shell. For nice layout in SQLite shell, run the commands 
.mode column 
.headers on

Grading:
This assignment will be auto-graded using SQLite. You are highly encouraged to use the same database to test your queries before submitting your assignment. Grading will use a different data set than the one given to students to test their queries. Therefore, make sure your queries are robust and that they work on any data instance. There is no partial credit in this homework.


===================================================================
Database:

This database is a modified version of the following dataset about video games sales.
Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales

Database Schema:

CREATE TABLE video_game(
   rank integer PRIMARY KEY,
   name text,
   platform_id integer, // foriegn key to platform.platform_id
   year integer,
   genre text,
   publisher_id integer // foriegn key to developer.id
); 
// platform is the console where users can play the video game (e.g., PlayStation 4)
// publisher is the company/developr that developed the game


CREATE TABLE region(
   id integer PRIMARY KEY,
   name text,
   population integer
);

CREATE TABLE games_sales(
   region_id integer, // foreign key to region.id
   game_rank integer, // foreign key to video_game.rank
   sales real,
   PRIMARY KEY (region_id, game_rank)
);

CREATE TABLE developer(
   id integer PRIMARY KEY,
   name text,
   headquarters text
);

CREATE TABLE platform(
   platform_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
   platform_name text,
   introductory_price_us integer,
   units_sold integer,
   developer_id integer  // foreign key to developer.id
);

// developer is the company that made the platform/console (e.g., Sony made PlayStation)

//Note: Every video game and platform has a developer. Therefore, both the video_game and platform tables have foreign keys to the developer table. It is important to pick the right connection (foreign key link) when joining tables.
