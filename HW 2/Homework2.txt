Due on: 9/26/2022 at 11:59 pm 
This assignment is to be completed by individuals. 
There will be a 10% penalty if the homework is submitted 24 hours after the due date, a 20% penalty if the homework is submitted 48 hours after the due date, or a 30% penalty if the homework is submitted 72 hours after the due date. The homework will not be accepted after 72 hours, as a solution will be posted by then.

Submission Instructions: 
Submit your answers using the hw2.py skeleton file included with this assignment (look at the homework tab in Brightspace/content). The python file is read by the autograder. It is important to have a syntax-error free file. The first and most important step is to write your Purdue username in the username function. Then, write your queries in the query1 to query15 functions. Your query answer should have the same attributes(columns) exactly in the same order as the expected result shown in each question. However, the rows can be in any order (i.e., you do not need to sort your rows). Before submitting your Python file execute the file using the command: Python3 hw2.py The output should contain all of your queries. Getting the correct output ensures that the autograder will be able to read your queries.

Submit your hw1.py in Brightspace/Assignments/Assignment 2
Make sure you submit the right file. 

Database import instructions:
For this assignment, use vieo_games.db SQLite database included in HW1. You can open the database by simply typing .open video_games.db in the SQLite shell. For nice layout in SQLite shell, run the commands 
.mode column 
.headers on

Grading:
This assignment will be auto-graded using SQLite. You are highly encouraged to use the same database to test your queries before submitting your assignment. Grading will use a different data set than the one given to students to test their queries. Therefore, make sure your queries are robust and that they work on any data instance. There is no partial credit in this homework.

===================================================================


Database:

This database is a modified version of the following dataset about video games sales.
Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales

Database Schema:

CREATE TABLE video_game(
   rank integer PRIMARY KEY,
   name text,
   platform_id integer, // foriegn key to platform.platform_id
   year integer,
   genre text,
   publisher_id integer // foriegn key to developer.id
); 
// platform is the console where users can play the video game (e.g., PlayStation 4)
// publisher is the company/developr that developed the game


CREATE TABLE region(
   id integer PRIMARY KEY,
   name text,
   population integer
);

CREATE TABLE games_sales(
   region_id integer, // foreign key to region.id
   game_rank integer, // foreign key to video_game.rank
   sales real,
   PRIMARY KEY (region_id, game_rank)
);

CREATE TABLE developer(
   id integer PRIMARY KEY,
   name text,
   headquarters text
);

CREATE TABLE platform(
   platform_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
   platform_name text,
   introductory_price_us integer,
   units_sold integer,
   developer_id integer  // foreign key to developer.id
);


Q1) (6 points) Find the most recent games in the video_game table (i.e., games released in the most recent year in the table).

Expected Result:
rank  name                       platform_id  year  genre    publisher_id
----  -------------------------  -----------  ----  -------  ------------

Q2) (6 points) Find genre(s) that have the largest number of games.

Expected Result:
genre    number_of_games
-------  ---------------
Shooter  10


Q3) (6 points) Find the number of games in each genre. Keep genres whose number is above the average number of games. For example, in the sample dataset, the average number of games in a genre is 5. Therefore, we keep genres with more than 5 games.

Expected output:
genre         games_in_genre
------------  --------------
Action        7
Platform      8
Role-Playing  8

Q4) (6 points) List platform(s) that achieved the highest revenue, where revenue is computed as the number of units sold * the introductory price in the US.

Expected Result:
platform_name  units_sold  introductory_price_us  revenue      developer_name
-------------  ----------  ---------------------  -----------  --------------
PS2            155000000   300                    46500000000  Sony


Q5) (7 points) For each publisher, find the game(s) that achieved the highest total sales for the publisher (consider only publishers who have games).

Expected Result:
rank  name                            platform_name  publisher             p_man      total_sales

Q6) (6 points) Find games whose total sales is below the average total sales per game. You will need to compute the toal sales for each game then compute the average for those totals.

Expected Output:

Q11) (10 points) Consider platform games as the number of games that run on a particular platform. A company's (developer) platform games is the number of games running on the company's platforms. A company published games are games developed by the company. List the number of platform and published games for every company (developer). Include the following comments:
- 'platform-focused' for companies whose number of platform games is larger than its number of published games.
- 'publish-focused' for companies whose number of published games is larger than its number of platform games.
- 'equally-focused' for companies whose number of published games is equal to its number of platform games.

For simplicity, you can assume no companies/developers will have platform games but no published games.
